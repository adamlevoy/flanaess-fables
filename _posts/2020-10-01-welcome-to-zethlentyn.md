title: Welcome to Zethlentyn, the grand city of the Drow

Several weeks have passed since our heroes freed the hamlet of Durhlong from its devil-may-care deity.

On the road to Zethlentyn, the party was ambushed by a group of elder bulettes and things looked grim as Scutters and Jer’amy went down for the count. Clever tactics by Aldon and Dreggard kept them all in the land of the living, and the only surviving bulette fled.

Arriving in the grand city of the Drow, the group hired a noble lady to guide them around. They met with the head of house Do’Urden who revealed her role as leader of the Celestilites.

The band of explorers decided to spend some time in Zethlentyn (or Z-town as Westin has dubbed it). Dreggard stayed very busy, splitting his time in between the Lizard racetrack with Aldon and the menagerie with Sanzac.

Little is known about how Jer’amy spent his time, Westin tried to tag along with him but was sternly told to mind his own business. Dejected, Westin decided to ease the pain by purchasing himself a fancy hand crossbow, he has been wearing it proudly on his back ever since.

The party did notice that Jer’amy walked into the Sun Slave a few mornings ago looking slightly sick. He was staggering a bit and rubbing his eyes frequently.
