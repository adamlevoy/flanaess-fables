Our epic saga continues with a Drow in distress, stuck in a massive spider web. Zim urged the caravan to move on, but the adventurers found it in their hearts to escort the entangled child to her family.
<br><br>
The distance was not great, but the mission proved to be quite eventful. Jer’amy triggered two glyphs that were set to ward off intruders, while Dreggard found himself slowed by a massive stone golem.
<br><br>
Sanzac disarmed the stone golem, aided by a recollection from the young Drow. The party snuck through a room of trickster mushrooms, then the air became cold.
<br><br>
The party had stumbled upon a haunted farmhouse where several undead lay in wait. The terrifying visage of a ghost shook the resolve of the mighty challengers, all except Scutters the Unshakeable!
<br><br>
Sanzac brought light to the darkness, burning the undead into non-existence. It was then, that a Drow hunting party, on the lookout for their kin, found the heroes.
<br><br>
The party peacefully exchanged the Drow child for some well deserved time in a restorative hot springs.
<br><br>
On their return to the main tunnels, they were ambushed by Hobgoblin bandits, demanding Dreggard’s magical battle axe. Sanzac opted for action over diplomacy and created a mighty eruption under their feet.
<br><br>
Soon after, Jer’amy added acid and cold damage to the fold, and howls could be heard from the black pit.
<br><br>
One bandit managed to escape, but not for long.
<br><br>
Sanzac hunted him down and after a fierce battle, the heroes emerged victorious, and Westin gained a new coin purse.
