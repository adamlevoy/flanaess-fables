Curiosity ran wild as the fortune-hunters investigated a suit of plate armor that sat beside a fast flowing stream.

As they closed in, the armor rose to its feet, but slipped on moss and started drifting down towards a deep chasm. Sanzac enchanted the water, freezing the armor in place.

From there, the armor was assaulted by many elements taking force damage and fire damage as its plates crunched, steamed and sizzled in the water.

The armor clambered out of the stream and slammed its body into a few members of the party before its curse was lifted and it fell to the ground.

Syrus, eager to get a closer look, tripped on his bootlace and fell into the stream. He gasped and splashed his way down to Eldrin, who waited with a rope.
The companions snagged the armor and went to stash their loot in a safe place.

Shortly after, they discovered a massive expanse of glimmering stones and sprawling fungi.

Scutters feasted on caps and stalks like a king while Eldrin found a rock that pleased him greatly.

Sanzac discovered the intended resting place for Durgeddin’s clan and detected magic emanating from the sarcophagi.

It was a harrowing few minutes as the bravery of the party was put into question.

Finally Dreggard tired of inaction and began tearing off the lids. Many were empty but one contained an ancient warhammer with the mark of the master smith on the handle.

The wanderers made their way to an intimidating iron door, but it proved no match for Eldrin’s cunning reflexes, as he probed the lock free.

The team made their way through some difficult obstacles and found themselves in an ancient foundry inhabited by Duergar.

The dark dwarves were hostile and asked to be left in peace, they were not initially satisfied by the group’s rationale for being there.

Battle ensued but shortly after, a female Duergar appeared escorted by two guards. She again asked the party to explain themselves, and eventually they made peace.

The adventurers profited from the knowledge of the Duergar – learning of several dangers that lay ahead.
Eldrin profited more than the others, as he gained a more intimate understanding of their ways.

After a short rest, Eldrin discovered a way to channel this new knowledge and mimic the stealthy skin of the Duergar.
