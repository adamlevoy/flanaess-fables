> ## STROLL THROUGH MUSHROOM FOREST TAKES TURN FOR THE WORSE
>
> Dreggard Borivik, a surface dweller and visitor to our fair town was attacked and left for dead several days ago. Witnesses saw a dark figure pounce from the cap of an elder bluestalk onto him, the victim was described to the Zethlentyn Reader as hairy and unkempt.
>
> Appearing as if a bath in a hot springs would certainly do him no harm in the least. Smoke covered the scene, and as it dissipated, the man could be seen lying lifeless on the ground. Luckily his associate discovered the healing properties of a nearby Dark Angel fungus which saved Dreggard from a most sinister demise.
>
> Following his resuscitation, the associate spent 15 minutes browsing the bountiful variety of shrooms our picturesque forest has on offer while his friend groaned and clutched at his still open wounds. Dark angel will restore life but doesn’t do much for the pain as we of the Underdark are well aware.
>
> We followed this tourist to his lodgings at the Sun Slave Inn. Azz’ya, the proprietress was interviewed afterwards and had this to say...
>
> ### “They left in such a hurry after the incident, I’m worried they’ll leave a negative review for my establishment”.
>
> We followed Dreggard and his band which also included a mousey fellow, a wrinkly old fossil, and a slithery druid. They exited the city by way of the surface passage and made their way towards the vile city of Enstad.
>
> They were stopped by a stone guardian who attacked them as they drew near. This reporter was initially impressed by the mousey one’s abilities with the hand crossbow, that is, until he attempted a longshot and took out the party’s flying companion, which appeared to be a large bat. It made a strange hooting noise as it was skewered. We were also proud to see the golden haired elf scaling the cliff walls, as only one touched by Lolth could have done with such grace.
>
> This correspondent was also shocked by the power nestled within the wrinkles of the elder human who dismantled the stone guardian with a flurry of energy blasts. That was just about the extent of sunlight that yours truly could stomach and the coverage of these odd visitors ends there.
