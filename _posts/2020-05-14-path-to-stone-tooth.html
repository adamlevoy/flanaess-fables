        You’ve traveled through the forests north of Blasingdell and discovered the base of The Stone Tooth. It’s currently 6:30p on the third day since you set out. <br><br>

A swift and fierce storm rolled through earlier in the day, Sanzac avoided exhaustion by shapeshifting into a tiger, Eldrin started feeling slightly fatigued after the storm dissipated. <br><br>

You’ve scouted two different paths, one that leads north to steep switchbacks that seem to lead to the mountaintop. The other leads to two Orc scouts who don’t appear to be taking their scouting duties very seriously. <br><br>

You are 60ft away from the Orcs and they haven’t noticed your presence.
