title: A betrayal worth a mine of Godsdream
author: Dungeon Master

Our team of rugged adventurers were startled when a Minotaur began questioning their choice of traveling companions. She left them with a warning about the Drow and also the Duergar. 

Jer’amy noted a change in Draenoss’ behavior as they drew closer and closer to their prize. Westin discovered the Duergar mine site ahead, which brought a tiny bit of warmth to Aldon’s cold, dead heart. 

Aldon tried to negotiate with the dark dwarves but could not find common ground and fighting broke out. Sanzac shook things up causing rocks to bury multiple enemies, but Dreggard was caught up as well. Aldon had mercy on a Duergar hammerer who was trapped inside a machine. 

After defeating the Duergar, nothing stood in the way of Draenoss and his Godsdream, nothing except our lovable band of heroes!!! 

Draenoss turned on the party and introduced them to his ally named Marwenye who promptly unleashed an insect plague upon them. Sanzac had a bit of an identity crisis, changing from bear, to yuan-ti, to snake - eventually grappling the old drow. 

Aldon fired an arrow through a swarm of locusts, surprising Draenoss and dropping him to the ground. The team rallied against Marwenye who called a demon to her aid. Tazolil came to the aid of the party and ran the old fossil through with his shortsword. 

And so, the Godsdream fell into the hands of the Underdark Voyagers.
