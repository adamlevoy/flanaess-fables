Bidding farewell to Stoneheim, the group met with Zim and his ‘Von Zeam Team’. They delved deep under the surface and began their journey through the underdark.
<br><br>
Jer’amy earned the respect of Nora, the she-dwarf, while Aldon had a little fun with the rearguard’s rears. Zim told some stories and morale was high until a faulty wheel slowed the caravan to a halt and Jer’amy felt compelled to investigate a strange energy in a side tunnel.
<br><br>
The tunnel led to a source of ancient magic which caught our courageous friends in a time loop with a delusional mage and a frisky Gynosphinx.
<br><br>
Both physical and mental faculties were strained as the Gynosphinx challenged the party to answer her riddles in order to be allowed to escape.
<br><br>
After successfully answering, the party tried to also negotiate the release of Gunther the mage, but Persemone the sphinx was too attached to him.
<br><br>
Returning to the carts, the party pondered the possibility of time travel and how they could have done things differently in the past.
<br><br>
Not long after their return, a pack of Ankhegs ambushed the VZT (Von Zeam Team). Aaron was snatched up in the vicious mandibles of an Ankheg as it began to burrow underground, but Sanzac’s heroics saved his life.
<br><br>
Slightly bloodied, but still on their feet, the caravan rested and once again, felt new powers surging into their bodies.
