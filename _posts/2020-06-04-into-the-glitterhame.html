    The six dungeon delvers made their way into the Glitterhame, where Archie flew a little too close to the ceiling and fell prey to a group of hungry stirges. <br><br>

    After the bug-bats were dispatched, Sanzac and Scutters split from the group while exploring new areas.<br><br>

    They found themselves ambushed by two Troglodytes. Scutters retreated and Sanzac screamed for help. Syrus scrambled in and assisted Sanzac in finishing off the Troglodyte scouts.<br><br>

    The heroes blasted through a makeshift barrier and found themselves in the heart of a Troglodyte Warren.<br><br>

    A fierce battle ensued between man, bug, Elf, Yuan-ti, and Lizard-kind. Dreggard felt drowsy, napping several times throughout the attack.<br><br>

    The Troglodyte Chieftain attempted to flee, casting invisibility on himself, but Eldrin’s Elven ears marked him, and when he became visible again, it was with an arrow through the neck.<br><br>

    Sanzac discovered a Troglodyte hatchery to the south and rallied Syrus to confront them, only to find that they were greatly outnumbered. Sanzac turned tail and ran to the safety of the Chieftain’s lair.<br><br>

    The party took a long rest and Archie 2.0 observed the Troglodytes relocating their hatchery. Following Archie’s lead, the team discovered the new hatchery, this time with improved defenses.<br><br>

    A giant subterranean lizard snapped at the Trog-foes as they began another vicious skirmish. Sanzac cast moonbeam and wreaked havoc on Troglodytes of all ages and sizes.<br><br>

    Syrus did his best to widen the doorway to the cave, firing many eldritch blasts directly into the rock wall.<br><br>

    It wasn’t very effective… Eldrin created the disguise of the century, assuming the likeness of a Trog and attempting to surprise them.<br><br>

    The fates held a surprise for him instead… his magical blade found the gut of a scuttery ally instead of a slimy foe.<br><br>

    Scutters fell to the floor and Eldrin, overcome with grief, scooped him up and disengaged from the fray. The giant lizard began striking out in desperation as the moonbeams continued to scald its flesh.<br><br>

    Eventually, Syrus tired of his rock renovation project and stepped into the cave and grabbed onto the lizard’s tail, shocking it to death.<br><br>
