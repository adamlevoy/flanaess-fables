The party was introduced to Anatheriel the statue who peppered them with advice.

Sanzac grudgingly licked his sword and Aldon offered up a bit of spit tribute as well. Corvus found a shocking surprise upon entering the crypt altar.

Dreggard took a spit bath and found a silver stash. Corvus bravely pulled some levers, and Aldon mage handled an ancient vase.

Dreggardâ€™s improved trap finally came in handy thanks to a well placed thorn whip.

When we last left our heroes, they were engaged with a slew of undead creatures within a room containing a prominent fountain of blood.
