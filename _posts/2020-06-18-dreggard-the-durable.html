    The Mountain Tooth Cleanup Squad awoke in the company of Duergar.
    <br><br>
    Nimira gladly showed them a secret path that led to a dark chasm where she claimed a black dragon nested.
    <br><br>
    Sanzac suddenly remembered important business he had back near the statue room and hurried away.
    <br><br>
    The team decided to spend some time mapping out the three dungeon levels they had explored thus far. They encountered a few adversaries along the way, including an animated table, a pack of Gricks, and a Troglodyte hunting party.
    <br><br>
    Confident they had a satisfactory map, and now in possession of another of Durgeddin’s legendary weapons, the champions decided to head back to Blasingdell to unload and regroup.
    <br><br>
    At the entrance to Khundrukar, they found the door shut. Upon investigation of the rift hall, Eldrin & Dreggard found secret paths to the north and south, inhabited by Orcish archers.
    <br><br>
    After slaying three, the final Orc surrendered and sought mercy from Sanzac’s Shiny-Orc-Cleaver. The party was loath to trust him, but their trust was rewarded when he revealed another hidden passage containing unspoiled loot.
    <br><br>
    Dreggard drug a heavy chest of treasure at the team’s flanks as Sanzac scouted through the forests towards Blasingdell.
    <br><br>
    A chance encounter with Owlbears set the adventurers back several pounds of meat, some rations and two goodberries.
    <br><br>
    As the heroes set camp on the second night, they were visited by a pack of wolves.
    <br><br>
    The pack sought the scent of none other than Dreggard the Durable. They led him into the forest where the sounds of tree felling could be heard.
    <br><br>
    Dreggard’s heart dropped upon discovering the reason for the late night wakeup call, a slain wolf cub.
    <br><br>
    Sadness quickly turned to rage as Dreggard charged forward to find the culprits.
