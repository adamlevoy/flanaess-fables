Sanzac led the way back to Zim’s caravan where the party was asked to help investigate some disappearances from Zim’s wares. The crew put on their detective hats and began sniffing for clues.
<br><br>
Aldon began by subtly hinting at the missing items with the Drow while Jer’amy got to know Nora, Aaron and Haleth better. Dreggard found Brendan practicing some martial moves and showed him a few moves of his own.
<br><br>
A lead suspect was yet to emerge, so Aldon decided to take a more direct approach. He searched Dinnozz’s bag while he slept and found the missing items. Zim was alerted and decided to confront the issue.
<br><br>
Dinnozz denied all claims and was enraged at the accusation. He drew his blade as the adventurers tried to mediate. Dreggard only exacerbated the issue and became a target for Dinnozz’s frustration.
<br><br>
A battle began and one of the Steeder’s joined the Drow cause, biting deep into Jer’amy’s hindquarters. Heavily outnumbered, the Drow were defeated but not killed.
<br><br>
Zim stared on in shock and Jer’amy noticed a hint of guilt in his eyes. Zim confessed that he planted the items in Dinnozz’s bag. Rhys convinced the party to continue on to Tyrybblyn with Zim locked up in a cart.
<br><br>
Not long after, voices were heard in the tunnels ahead. A caravan of Svirfneblin were preparing for a vampire attack, they offered their materials to help build up defenses and Dreggard used his knowledge of nature and survival to devise a plan.
