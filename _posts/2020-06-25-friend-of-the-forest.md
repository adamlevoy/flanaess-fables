“Are you a friend of the forest?”

The question echoes in the minds of our heroes as they recall the moral dilemma they currently face.

Two days have passed since Dreggard raced off in a fury towards a lumber camp where he suspected foul play was afoot. He sought the aid of his brothers in arms, but they were hesitant to wage war at the whims of a wild man.

Eldrin became one with the shadows as he scouted the camp, discovering an interesting concoction in a drinking trough near some beasts of burden.

The team decided it would be wise to confer with the Mayor before acting rashly. They traveled back to Blasingdell but before they had reached the walls, they were confronted with a familiar sight.

ORCS!!! The brutes were leading a troll along the forest path.

Seeing that the Troll was no friend of his captors, Syrus freed him as his companions slew the Orc patrol.

Back in town, Dreggard was seen sporting a new pair of goggles, recently acquired through trade with Baron Althon.

Eldrin discovered the nature of the lumber camp cocktail, and Syrus received a letter of recommendation from the Mayor, agreeing to provide protection to the camp.

The party left town with mixed feelings when they were visited once again by the wandering wolf pack. This time, the wolves brought them to a band of Ehlonnian resistance fighters.

There they met Tadriel, a beautiful warrior whose copper hair complimented her polished plate armor. She asked for their help in bringing destruction to the Mayor’s lumber camp.

The passion and energy from these two rival forces invigorated the adventurers, and they felt new power rising up inside.
