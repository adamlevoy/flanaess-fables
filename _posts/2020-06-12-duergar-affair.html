    Curiosity ran wild as the fortune-hunters investigated a suit of plate armor that sat beside a fast flowing stream.
    <br><br>
    As they closed in, the armor rose to its feet, but slipped on moss and started drifting down towards a deep chasm. Sanzac enchanted the water, freezing the armor in place.
    <br><br>
    From there, the armor was assaulted by many elements taking force damage and fire damage as its plates crunched, steamed and sizzled in the water.
    <br><br>
    The armor clambered out of the stream and slammed its body into a few members of the party before its curse was lifted and it fell to the ground.
    <br><br>
    Syrus, eager to get a closer look, tripped on his bootlace and fell into the stream. He gasped and splashed his way down to Eldrin, who waited with a rope.
    <br><br>
    The companions snagged the armor and went to stash their loot in a safe place.
    <br><br>
    Shortly after, they discovered a massive expanse of glimmering stones and sprawling fungi.
    <br><br>
    Scutters feasted on caps and stalks like a king while Eldrin found a rock that pleased him greatly.
    <br><br>
    Sanzac discovered the intended resting place for Durgeddin’s clan and detected magic emanating from the sarcophagi.
    <br><br>
    It was a harrowing few minutes as the bravery of the party was put into question.
    <br><br>
    Finally Dreggard tired of inaction and began tearing off the lids. Many were empty but one contained an ancient warhammer with the mark of the master smith on the handle.
    <br><br>
    The wanderers made their way to an intimidating iron door, but it proved no match for Eldrin’s cunning reflexes, as he probed the lock free.
    <br><br>
    The team made their way through some difficult obstacles and found themselves in an ancient foundry inhabited by Duergar.
    <br><br>
    The dark dwarves were hostile and asked to be left in peace, they were not initially satisfied by the group’s rationale for being there.
    <br><br>
    Battle ensued but shortly after, a female Duergar appeared escorted by two guards. She again asked the party to explain themselves, and eventually they made peace.
    <br><br>
    The adventurers profited from the knowledge of the Duergar – learning of several dangers that lay ahead.
    <br><br>
    Eldrin profited more than the others, as he gained a more intimate understanding of their ways.
    <br><br>
    After a short rest, Eldrin discovered a way to channel this new knowledge and mimic the stealthy skin of the Duergar.
