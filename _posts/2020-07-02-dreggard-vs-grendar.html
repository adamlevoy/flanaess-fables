As night fell and darkness spread across the forest, we found our adventurers excitedly discussing tactics.
<br><br>
Tadriel and her centaur companion looked on in apparent amusement at the debate. It was decided that Syrus should attempt to trick the guards into returning to Blasingdell.
<br><br>
His disguise was solid, and his summons were credible, but he lacked the conviction in his voice to sway Grendar from his post. Dreggard appealed to Grendar’s competitive nature, challenging him to an arm wrestling rematch.
<br><br>
After suffering a crippling loss, Dreggard raised the stakes and attempted to win back his honor. This time, a toast was made to the god of wrist strength… Wristopher.
<br><br>
Grendar failed to notice that Eldrin had spiked his drink. The drugged drink allowed the Captain to easily best Dreggard once again, but upon looking back at his adversary, he was struck by the shine of his greasy hair and thickness of his chin curtain.
<br><br>
Sanzac could no longer stand the enslavement of the woodland creatures and freed a young centaur who made a run for it but quickly fell prey to a hidden trap.
<br><br>
Xarmos the druid was alerted and came out to demand an explanation. Unsatisfied, he hurled an ice bolt at the intruders.
<br><br>
In response, Syrus channeled his dark energy and unleashed two powerful blasts directly into Xarmos’ stomach forcing him to retreat to the safety of his tented headquarters.
<br><br>
Eldrin had disappeared in the darkness and stealthily marked Xarmos from the backside of the tent. With two swift movements, Eldrin created an opening in the tent and skewered Xarmos through the throat, unleashing a Shadow Demon that slowly slinked out of the dying druid.
<br><br>
Caught by surprise, Eldrin took a demonic claw to the face. The others began barraging the tent with magic, melting nearly everything inside, including the demon.
<br><br>
Outside, the remnants of the guard were falling like flies. Grendar, still charmed by the potion, helped free the remaining animals who fled to the safety of the forest.
<br><br>
Sanzac, haunted by the bloodshed, turned his attention to the half-orc and began to roast him inside his armor. Grendar attempted to flee but was followed and slain by the frenzied spellcaster.
<br><br>
The battle wore heavily on the hearts of the heroes, Eldrin provided a welcome distraction as he pulled out Xarmos’ wooden staff…
