The voyage through the Underdark continued as the group found themselves once again faced with the challenge of crossing the poison pools. 

Aldon decided to make use of his new arachnid abilities, scaling the cavern walls. Westin and Dreggard stumbled into the green goo and were attacked by an ancient guardian. With Dreggard in its clutches, the ancient guardian began to sink into the depths. 

Sanzac, realizing poison pools weren’t Dreggard’s favored terrain, pulled him onto a nearby rock. But his safety was only temporary... a second monstrosity grappled his paralyzed body and tried to escape but Tazolil pierced it’s brain through with his short sword. 

After clearing the pools, the hardy bunch found their way to Draenoss’ stalagmite tower and uncovered some valuable items for their journey. They carefully avoided some magical traps set to dissuade sticky fingers. 

Caught up in the thrill of the hunt, the team neglected to notice that Tazolil had given them the slip, heading back to Tyrybblyn. 

Dreggard charmed a couple of Rothe into taking the Drow’s place while Jer’amy acted on a telepathic prompt from a mysterious being. He led the crew to the well defended hamlet of Durhlong where they met some interesting characters. 

They searched for the source of the message but their questions only created more questions. They were left with a strange feeling in the pit of their stomachs after visiting with the town religious leader, Cirederill. She offered to initiate them into the order of Lliar’ryathoss’ faithful with a promise of power if they were deemed worthy. 

Eventually the party retired to their quarters to study some of the manuscripts discovered earlier at the wizard’s tower. Sleep and a deep trance slowly overtook them that night - even Jer’amy who had been in the habit of not sleeping at all. 

The last thing they remembered was an odd smell followed by a hazy vapor creeping through the closed door.
