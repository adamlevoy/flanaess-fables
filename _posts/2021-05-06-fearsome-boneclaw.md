The cunning wizard Draggerd was able to harness the Artifact’s power to restore Finethir back to his original form, but after the game ended, Dreggard retained no memory of how to use it. It was instead entrusted to Aldon.

Dreggard persuaded the group to explore the rest of the crypts, hoping to add to his silver collection. It wasn’t long before he found himself possessed by a ghost.

Aldon did what Aldon does best, downing zombies like a thirsty dwarf downs ale.

In another room, the party was acquainted with a beast that Sanzac had met once before: a fearsome **Boneclaw**.

It’s ferocious countenance was quickly polymorphed into a mildly intimidating butterfly.

Corvus and Sanzac created an ultra moon beam together which burned several wights and ogre zombies into dust. The only friendly casualty was a reinforced hunting trap, smashed to pieces by a hulking zombie.

Corvus, drunk on the power of the UMB, turned it on the butterfly and Mr. Boneclaw re-emerged, He clawed into the halfling, rendering him unconscious.

Archie wasn’t having it, he swooped in and rescued Corvus from the clutches of the undead abomination while Aldon fired arrows from the shadows.

The goodberries never tasted so good to Corvus and Dreggard as they rose to their feet, ready to delve deeper into the crypt.
