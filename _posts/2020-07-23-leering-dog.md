Time has passed since the adventurers arrived in Stoneheim. They made quite a splash on their first night, rescuing a local man from a blazing fire and vanquishing a devil and his entourage.

The action slowed down for the next two weeks and this allowed the party to spend time pursuing some of life’s simpler pleasures.

Dreggard and Scutters sought buried treasure in the many dumpsters lining the Stoneheim streets.

Jer’amy dusted off his scroll writing technique, surprising several guild members with his superior penmanship and efficiency.

Aldon wined and dined the locals under his guise as a diplomat while Sanzac kept a low profile, keeping up with the gossip and news from the patrons of the Leering Dog. He kept his distance from the Noddy Wheel, which he became convinced was rigged.

The time came for the travelers to ramble on, they reflected on this time of peace with fondness, but their dauntless spirits burned with a desire to march on. The Fab Four met on the stoop of the Leering Dog where they were joined by a familiar face.
