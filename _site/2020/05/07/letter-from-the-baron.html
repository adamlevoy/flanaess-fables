        <p>Greetings Adventurer,</p>

<p>Word of thy exploits has reached my ears and I must say, I’m impressed by what you have accomplished thus far. I also have dabbled in adventuring, but raising seven children has greatly inhibited my ability to leave town for long periods of time.</p>

<p>The citizens of Blasingdell all share a keen interest in fine weaponry, and local legend has it that the great dwarf smith Durgeddin the Black once held a stronghold called Khundrukar not far from our town, underneath The Stone Tooth, a rugged, forested hill crowned by a bare, rocky crag. If I have calculated it correctly, it should be about three days journey North from our walls. I’m paying 20 gold for information about the area and 100 gold for a map of the stronghold.</p>

<p>In addition, I will purchase any weapon you find bearing Durgeddin’s mark for two times the market value! Dwarves are cunning folk, and I would wager there are lavish treasures that lie undiscovered in the depths of Khundrukar.</p>

<p>If I have judged thee correctly, this information should light a spark in thy chest. Come see me in Blasingdell and I will show you the mark of Durgeddin and answer any questions you may have.</p>

<p>May Ulaa protect us all,
Baron Althon</p>
