&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sanzac laid down the mighty moonbeam, while Aldon heated things up.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dreggard spawned an expanse of poky scratchies, and on top of it all, Westin stood ready to unleash a makeshift battering ram.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The zombies blazed forward into the fray while the vampires climbed around walls covered with flaming spiderwebs. Those who were lucky enough to advance through the obstacles were pelted by darts and bolts.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An ancient Vampire managed to close in on Jer’amy and grab hold of his wrinkly flesh, but in a flash, Jer’amy popped out of harm’s way. Without a victim to feed upon, the vampire tried to flee, but was trapped by the moonbeam and destroyed with a stake to the heart.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At this point, Westin rushed in with blade in hand towards a Vampire Spawn who was quickly approaching. The party looked on in shock as the two clashed and not one, but two bites were exchanged.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the end, the Vampires were felled and the Svirfneblin were saved.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The adventurers continued on their way to Tyrybblyn.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upon arrival, they were led to the headquarters of House Claddatar and accepted their reward for delivering the treacherous merchant Zim. They also accepted a courier mission, delivering Celestilite schematics to Zethlentyn.

We find our heroes at the Slaughtered Star, preparing for a journey to the surface.

The crew put on their detective hats and began sniffing for clues.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aldon began by subtly hinting at the missing items with the Drow while Jer’amy got to know Nora, Aaron and Haleth better. Dreggard found Brendan practicing some martial moves and showed him a few moves of his own.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A lead suspect was yet to emerge, so Aldon decided to take a more direct approach. He searched Dinnozz’s bag while he slept and found the missing items. Zim was alerted and decided to confront the issue.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dinnozz denied all claims and was enraged at the accusation. He drew his blade as the adventurers tried to mediate. Dreggard only exacerbated the issue and became a target for Dinnozz’s frustration.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A battle began and one of the Steeder’s joined the Drow cause, biting deep into Jer’amy’s hindquarters. Heavily outnumbered, the Drow were defeated but not killed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Zim stared on in shock and Jer’amy noticed a hint of guilt in his eyes. Zim confessed that he planted the items in Dinnozz’s bag. Rhys convinced the party to continue on to Tyrybblyn with Zim locked up in a cart.

Zim urged the caravan to move on, but the adventurers found it in their hearts to escort the entangled child to her family.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The distance was not great, but the mission proved to be quite eventful. Jer’amy triggered two glyphs that were set to ward off intruders, while Dreggard found himself slowed by a massive stone golem.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sanzac disarmed the stone golem, aided by a recollection from the young Drow. The party snuck through a room of trickster mushrooms, then the air became cold.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The party had stumbled upon a haunted farmhouse where several undead lay in wait. The terrifying visage of a ghost shook the resolve of the mighty challengers, all except Scutters the Unshakeable!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sanzac brought light to the darkness, burning the undead into non-existence. It was then, that a Drow hunting party, on the lookout for their kin, found the heroes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The party peacefully exchanged the Drow child for some well deserved time in a restorative hot springs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On their return to the main tunnels, they were ambushed by Hobgoblin bandits, demanding Dreggard’s magical battle axe. Sanzac opted for action over diplomacy and created a mighty eruption under their feet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Soon after, Jer’amy added acid and cold damage to the fold, and howls could be heard from the black pit.

They delved deep under the surface and began their journey through the underdark.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jer’amy earned the respect of Nora, the she-dwarf, while Aldon had a little fun with the rearguard’s rears. Zim told some stories and morale was high until a faulty wheel slowed the caravan to a halt and Jer’amy felt compelled to investigate a strange energy in a side tunnel.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The tunnel led to a source of ancient magic which caught our courageous friends in a time loop with a delusional mage and a frisky Gynosphinx.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Both physical and mental faculties were strained as the Gynosphinx challenged the party to answer her riddles in order to be allowed to escape.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After successfully answering, the party tried to also negotiate the release of Gunther the mage, but Persemone the sphinx was too attached to him.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returning to the carts, the party pondered the possibility of time travel and how they could have done things differently in the past.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not long after their return, a pack of Ankhegs ambushed the VZT (Von Zeam Team). Aaron was snatched up in the vicious mandibles of an Ankheg as it began to burrow underground, but Sanzac’s heroics saved his life.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She recognized the smell of these adventurers and noted their fear at her appearance. Just as she was about to strike, Syrus offered her information about a very vulnerable town not far away which caused the beast to froth.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She demanded a tribute from the party so as not to leave empty handed and Dreggard sacrificed a prized gold ring. Pleased, Nightscale took off to the southeast.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On the fifth day, Archie hooted excitedly that the city of Stoneheim was in sight. The party altered their appearances and gained entry through the gates.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Inside the city, Aldon was recognized by a shady Halfling in an alley. The short fellow slipped something into Aldon’s hands before disappearing into the shadows.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The party made their way to a modest tavern and proceeded to burn off some stress by drinking and gambling. Jer’amy had the golden touch, while Sanzac couldn’t win a penny.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dreggared continued his legacy of challenging half-orcs to arm wrestling bouts, winning against the local tough guy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The crew rented rooms at the Dog and slept on beds for the first time in several nights when they were awoken by screams and curses. They hurried outside to find a nearby warehouse in flames.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sanzac began funneling water into the building but it wasn’t enough to douse the entirety which was filled with flammable flour crates. Jumping inside, Jer’amy found himself ambushed by Kobolds who were led by a demon!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The battle and the fires raged furiously. Jer’amy fell to a fire blast from the fiend but rose back up with the aid of Dreggard’s great berries. Jer’amy returned fire at the devil and his blast hit the bullseye, cracking several devil ribs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aldon peppered the room with errant arrows from the outside of the building, and then rushed in through the door piercing the devil through the chest.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jer’amy discovered a captive who was trapped in a room to the north. He blasted open the door and rushed through a flame wall, grabbing onto the frightened man and teleporting him to safety.

They arrived at a tavern nestled deep in the woods.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The party learned of Tadriel’s cause and history over a couple of rounds of irresistible liqueur. These moments of tranquility did not last long, as ghosts from Syrus’ past appeared and goaded the party into a brawl.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Syrus made an electrifying exit and Sanzac drew his blade. Scutters, in his element, unleashed a fury of bites, dropping several of the antagonists to the ground.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Archie swooped in from above, dropping his payload on the Half-Orc that had made Syrus’ childhood a living hell.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The leader of the thugs surrendered and fled, nearly running straight into Syrus who was waiting outside. Syrus, tired of the senseless violence, let his adversary flee. Tadriel departed for the Kingdom of Celene, offering further work and rewards there.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Eldrin learned of several routes to Celene from a local, while Sanzac poured his heart (and some Sugar Sap) out to a thirsty snake. The decision was made to travel to Stoneheim and seek transport to Celene.

The next day the team set off and marched for nearly 20 hours straight! As they settled down to recuperate, a Mind Flayer and his minions were drawn to their campfire.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tadriel and her centaur companion looked on in apparent amusement at the debate. It was decided that Syrus should attempt to trick the guards into returning to Blasingdell.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His disguise was solid, and his summons were credible, but he lacked the conviction in his voice to sway Grendar from his post. Dreggard appealed to Grendar’s competitive nature, challenging him to an arm wrestling rematch.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After suffering a crippling loss, Dreggard raised the stakes and attempted to win back his honor. This time, a toast was made to the god of wrist strength… Wristopher.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Grendar failed to notice that Eldrin had spiked his drink. The drugged drink allowed the Captain to easily best Dreggard once again, but upon looking back at his adversary, he was struck by the shine of his greasy hair and thickness of his chin curtain.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sanzac could no longer stand the enslavement of the woodland creatures and freed a young centaur who made a run for it but quickly fell prey to a hidden trap.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Xarmos the druid was alerted and came out to demand an explanation. Unsatisfied, he hurled an ice bolt at the intruders.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In response, Syrus channeled his dark energy and unleashed two powerful blasts directly into Xarmos’ stomach forcing him to retreat to the safety of his tented headquarters.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Eldrin had disappeared in the darkness and stealthily marked Xarmos from the backside of the tent. With two swift movements, Eldrin created an opening in the tent and skewered Xarmos through the throat, unleashing a Shadow Demon that slowly slinked out of the dying druid.

Caught by surprise, Eldrin took a demonic claw to the face. The others began barraging the tent with magic, melting nearly everything inside, including the demon.

Outside, the remnants of the guard were falling like flies. Grendar, still charmed by the potion, helped free the remaining animals who fled to the safety of the forest.

Sanzac, haunted by the bloodshed, turned his attention to the half-orc and began to roast him inside his armor. Grendar attempted to flee but was followed and slain by the frenzied spellcaster.

Tadriel and her centaur companion looked on in apparent amusement at the debate. It was decided that Syrus should attempt to trick the guards into returning to Blasingdell. His disguise was solid, and his summons were credible, but he lacked the conviction in his voice to sway Grendar from his post. Dreggard appealed to Grendar’s competitive nature, challenging him to an arm wrestling rematch. After suffering a crippling loss, Dreggard raised the stakes and attempted to win back his honor. This time, a toast was made to the god of wrist strength… Wristopher. Grendar failed to notice that Eldrin had spiked his drink. The drugged drink allowed the Captain to easily best Dreggard once again, but upon looking back at his adversary, he was struck by the shine of his greasy hair and thickness of his chin curtain. Sanzac could no longer stand the enslavement of the woodland creatures and freed a young centaur who made a run for it but quickly fell prey to a hidden trap. Xarmos the druid was alerted and came out to demand an explanation. Unsatisfied, he hurled an ice bolt at the intruders. In response, Syrus channeled his dark energy and unleashed two powerful blasts directly into Xarmos’ stomach forcing him to retreat to the safety of his tented headquarters. Eldrin had disappeared in the darkness and stealthily marked Xarmos from the backside of the tent. With two swift movements, Eldrin created an opening in the tent and skewered Xarmos through the throat, unleashing a Shadow Demon that slowly slinked out of the dying druid.

    “Are you a friend of the forest?”
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The question echoes in the minds of our heroes as they recall the moral dilemma they currently face.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Two days have passed since Dreggard raced off in a fury towards a lumber camp where he suspected foul play was afoot. He sought the aid of his brothers in arms, but they were hesitant to wage war at the whims of a wild man.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Eldrin became one with the shadows as he scouted the camp, discovering an interesting concoction in a drinking trough near some beasts of burden.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The team decided it would be wise to confer with the Mayor before acting rashly. They traveled back to Blasingdell but before they had reached the walls, they were confronted with a familiar sight.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    ORCS!!! The brutes were leading a troll along the forest path.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Seeing that the Troll was no friend of his captors, Syrus freed him as his companions slew the Orc patrol.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Back in town, Dreggard was seen sporting a new pair of goggles, recently acquired through trade with Baron Althon.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Eldrin discovered the nature of the lumber camp cocktail, and Syrus received a letter of recommendation from the Mayor, agreeing to provide protection to the camp.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The party left town with mixed feelings when they were visited once again by the wandering wolf pack. This time, the wolves brought them to a band of Ehlonnian resistance fighters.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    There they met Tadriel, a beautiful warrior whose copper hair complimented her polished plate armor. She asked for their help in bringing destruction to the Mayor’s lumber camp.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The passion and energy from these two rival forces invigorated the adventurers, and they felt new power rising up inside.

    The Mountain Tooth Cleanup Squad awoke in the company of Duergar.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Nimira gladly showed them a secret path that led to a dark chasm where she claimed a black dragon nested.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Sanzac suddenly remembered important business he had back near the statue room and hurried away.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The team decided to spend some time mapping out the three dungeon levels they had explored thus far. They encountered a few adversaries along the way, including an animated table, a pack of Gricks, and a Troglodyte hunting party.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Confident they had a satisfactory map, and now in possession of another of Durgeddin’s legendary weapons, the champions decided to head back to Blasingdell to unload and regroup.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    At the entrance to Khundrukar, they found the door shut. Upon investigation of the rift hall, Eldrin &amp; Dreggard found secret paths to the north and south, inhabited by Orcish archers.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    After slaying three, the final Orc surrendered and sought mercy from Sanzac’s Shiny-Orc-Cleaver. The party was loath to trust him, but their trust was rewarded when he revealed another hidden passage containing unspoiled loot.

    Dreggard drug a heavy chest of treasure at the team’s flanks as Sanzac scouted through the forests towards Blasingdell.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    A chance encounter with Owlbears set the adventurers back several pounds of meat, some rations and two goodberries.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    As the heroes set camp on the second night, they were visited by a pack of wolves.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The pack sought the scent of none other than Dreggard the Durable. They led him into the forest where the sounds of tree felling could be heard.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Dreggard’s heart dropped upon discovering the reason for the late night wakeup call, a slain wolf cub.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Sadness quickly turned to rage as Dreggard charged forward to find the culprits.
